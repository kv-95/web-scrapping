Web scraping is the process of collecting structured web data in an automated fashion using bots. _**Web scraping is not an illegal process but it becomes one when someone uses it for illegal actions.**_ There are certain rules that one must follow while doing scraping [[1]](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_web_scraping/legality_of_python_web_scraping.htm). 

In short, one must not access private data of any user from any website and strict to those data which are publicaly available. Also refer to the _robots.txt_ of websites to know which all pages are available for scraping. 

The code given scrapes product details (name and price) available on the first page of _Amazon_ by taking the product name from user. When the code is executed the program asks user for product name and after execution creates a csv file in the same folder as the code.
